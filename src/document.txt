Vid editor

Back end

What it does on the high level:
    -take an video file and covert it to audio
    -use a transcribing api to get all the subtitle and timecode of the video
    -return data as json file with word, starttime, endtime.
    -process the subtitle and send the processed timestamp for processing
    -convert individual word into blocks of word
    -send timecode of blocked words for editing
    -and finally render the video to output


Potential features:
    -trim dead silences based on user preset tolerense
    -layout the dead silence in the UI
    -use AI to make sense of the texts to automate the cutting process.


stacks needed:
    -a transcribing api
    -a editing tool like moviepy
    -some kind of UI for the editing part


note: 
    -might be able to use something in jumpcutter from github
    -set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=


TODO:
    $-get sample timecode file, first look is google speech to text
    $-get a sample json file
    $-extract time code end to end
    $-do a mock editing
    -build basic editing ui.

Front end 

Main idea
    -2 column one for the text and one for video preview
    -video player play based on called second.
    -text will be pulled from json transcription.

TODO:
   // line start with = is completed

    =-build a video player first
    =-add include key and value to json file
    =-implement te Json fetch
    =-modify the data to add include object
    =-implement multi select button
    =-fix multi select state no updating imeediatly
    =-add break point when scale down to vertical
    =-now lets add basic style to the editor
    =-fuck i gotta learn design and make a good looking ui
    -add del and recover button


when I click on preview mode, im gonna set previewmode to true, read the timeblock

if the timeblock is not [], call a function to watch for second 10 and log it 

as soon as the second go over the conditioned time, seekto the next time

let's inplment a for loop everytime the playpoint change, it's gonna loop through time block 
and find which index the playpoint belong to.

I want the border and background color to be none when nothing happens, On hover, I want a little bit of 
shadow. on click I want green. On delete I want gray. on play I want green aswell

when I click and drag i want all dragged button to highlight, push these word to slectedWord, word.jsx will look into the
and modify the styling acodringly, video to be seekto the last element of the state.

onmousedown will set mouseIsDown to true and push the word in slectedWord, useffect listen for mousedIsdown, 
and then call
